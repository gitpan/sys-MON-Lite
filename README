sys-mon-lite

This is the second, early release

Module documentation and test suite is scant and in want of more work

sys::mon::lite is here expressed as an idea - a simple management framework for small systems that can be expanded by the addition of plugins

'sys::mon::lite' is intended for use:

* as a framework for managing a system by means of an extendible plugin mechanism
* to manage single or multiple system checks, calculating an overall alert level based on the output of a given set of pre-registered plugins
* to augment the monitoring capabilities of existing monitoring solutions
* where use of full scale monitoring applications the likes of Nagios, BigBrother etc to monitor a systems availability and / or performance may not be practical and where a simple, stand alone, Perl based solution will suffice
